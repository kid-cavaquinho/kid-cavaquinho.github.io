Hello 👋

My name is João [ʒuˈɐ̃w̃] and I live in Europe. I have built this place with the help of [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) and the Jekyll theme [type](https://github.com/aspirethemes/type). ❤️

Here I will write articles about subjects or topics I learn and find interesting. Later on, search engines might index these static pages. Hopefully, you find them useful. 📰

I'm disabling the comments option for the time being, but I would still love to hear from you. Please feel free to reach me via email 📧.
