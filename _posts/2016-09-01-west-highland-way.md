The [West Highland Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Highland_Way) is a long-distance trail in Scotland quite popular among walkers, hikers, runners or even mountain bike cyclists. This trail is about 150km long and follows ancient and old military roads, it was officialy open in 1980.

I have planned to walk it some months beforehand and looking at the weather forecasts it seems Scotland is quite unpredictable. Having this in mind I've decided to schedule a route and book in advance bed and breakfasts or guest houses along the trail. I've came up with the following plan:

+ Day 1 -> __Milngavie to Carbeth__ (8km) [.gpx](/content/whw/gpx/day-1-milngavie-to-carbeth.gpx) [.kml](/content/whw/kml/day-1-milngavie-to-carbeth.kml)
+ Day 2 -> __Carbeth to Drymen__ (11.2km) [.gpx](/content/whw/gpx/day-2-carbeth-to-drymen.gpx) [.kml](/content/whw/kml/day-2-carbeth-to-drymen.kml)
+ Day 3 -> __Drymen to Rowardennan__ (23km) [.gpx](/content/whw/gpx/day-3-drymen-to-rowardennan.gpx) [.kml](/content/whw/kml/day-3-drymen-to-rowardennan.kml)
+ Day 4 -> __Rowardennan to Inverarnan__ (22.4km) [.gpx](/content/whw/gpx/day-4-rowardennan-to-inverarnan.gpx) [.kml](/content/whw/kml/day-4-rowardennan-to-ardlui-and-inverarnan.kml)
+ Day 5 -> __Inverarnan to Tyndrum__ (19.6km) [.gpx](/content/whw/gpx/day-5-inverarnan-to-tyndrum.gpx) [.kml](/content/whw/kml/day-5-ardlui-and-inverarnan-to-tyndrum.kml)
+ Day 6 -> __Tyndrum to Bridge of Orchy__ (11.2km) [.gpx](/content/whw/gpx/day-6-tyndrum-to-bridge-of-orchy.gpx) [.kml](/content/whw/kml/day-6-tyndrum-to-bridge-of-orchy.kml)
+ Day 7 -> __Bridge of Orchy to Kingshouse__ (19.2km) [.gpx](/content/whw/gpx/day-7-bridge-of-orchy-to-kingshouse.gpx) [.kml](/content/whw/kml/day-7-bridge-of-orchy-to-kingshouse.kml)
+ Day 8 -> __Kingshouse to Kinlochleven__ (14.4km) [.gpx](/content/whw/gpx/day-8-kingshouse-to-kinglochleven.gpx) [.kml](/content/whw/kml/day-8-kingshouse-to-kinglochleven.kml)
+ Day 9 -> __Kinlochleven to Fort William__ (24 km) [.gpx](/content/whw/gpx/day-9-kinlochleven-to-fort-william.gpx) [.kml](/content/whw/kml/day-9-kinlochleven-to-fort-william.kml)

The path is very well marked, you will see the West Highland Way sign quite often. Nevertheless, I would advise you to buy a waterproof map of the trail and a compass.

I've just landed in Glasgow, Scotland, I can't hide that I am a bit nervous... after all this will be my first long distance hiking trail. A bus takes me from the airport to the heart of Glasgow city center, from there I get on a train to Milngavie (__pronounced 'Mulguye'__).

## Day 1 - Milngavie to Carbeth

The trail starts in the center of the town, a granite obelisk marks the spot. I am travelling quite light and since I do not have camping gear with me I quickly arrive in Carbeth. The elevation is quite low so far and I feel that I could continue to Drymen, but since I have booked accommodation on advance, that is not an option.

## Day 2 - Carbeth to Drymen

The elevation is still quite low and the path is still quite easy to walk as can be seen in the picture.

## Day 3 - Drymen to Rowardennan

![alt text](https://antao.github.io/content/whw/images/drymen-to-rowardennan.JPG "Drymen to Rowardennan")

In the picture above you can see Loch Lomond and the [Conic Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conic_Hill). The Conic Hill separates the lowlands from the highlands. From the highest point, the path descents quite steeply to the beautiful village of Balmaha were I stop to lunch by the pier, nearby there is a statue of [Tom Weir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Weir).

Balmaha is the last place I will find an automated banking machine until reaching Kinlochleven, so I take some extra money with me. The path follows along Loch Lomond, which is quite beautiful.

At this point because it is summer might be a good time to get your repellent spray because of the [midges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highland_midge).

The rain felt hard on me during the day and my legs start to feel tired, luckily when I arrived to Rowardennan the sun shined again and I could enjoy this view. There are some restaurants, a campsite and hotels in Rowardennan.

## Day 4 - Rowardennan to Inverarnan

The path goes along Loch Lomond and it is slightly harder than in the previous days, the elevation is about 500 meters. It will take me about five hours to walk 22km until I reach Inverarnan. After this long walk, I stop in the [Beinglas campsite](https://www.beinglascampsite.co.uk/) there I found a shop and restaurant/bar with very friendly staff. Nearby, there is a hotel with over three hundred years of history called [Drover's Inn](https://www.droversinn.co.uk/).

## Day 5 - Inverarnan to Tyndrum

From Inverarnan on the path becomes more mountainous, the landscape is now quite different from the previous days. The weather is now quite foggy and these are the Highlands I had imagined: __mountains surrounded in air of mystery__. In Tyndrum, there is a small supermarket, a few restaurants and a campsite.

## Day 6 - Tyndrum to Bridge of Orchy

Today is a shorter distance day, just 11km with a small elevation from Tyndrum to Bridge of Orchy. I have time today to rest well before the last days. In this village, there is a restaurant in the local hotel.

## Day 7 - Bridge of Orchy to Kingshouse

The [Scottish breakfast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_breakfast#Scotland) helps me to get going in the morning. Today, the path follows an old military road until Kingshouse, from there you will be confronted with the impressive wild beauty of the Glencoe mountain. Close to Kingshouse, there is a [campsite](http://www.glencoemountain.co.uk/), in the campsite there is a restaurant. Nearby, there is an [hotel](http://www.kingshousehotel.co.uk/).

## Day 8 - Kingshouse to Kinlochleven

From Kingshouse I continue along old military roads, at a certain point I will reach the known ascent [Devil's Staircase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aonach_Eagach#Devil.27s_Staircase). I do not find it very difficult compared with previous days, elevation is about 400 meters. The weather is misty, so I descent quite carefully until Kinlochleven. Kinlochleven is a very small village with some restaurants and a supermarket.

## Day 9 - Kinlochleven to Fort William

![alt text](https://antao.github.io/content/whw/images/kinlochleven.JPG "Kinlochleven to Fort William")

This is one of the hardest days, you will pass through some isolated areas along a scenic route. It is quite impressive to sight [Ben Nevis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Nevis) for the first time. The walking trail ends in the town of Fort William.

In Fort William, I bump into some familiar faces I've been crossing paths in the last days. Everyone seems to express a feeling of accomplishment and honestly, I feel it too. On the next day I take a train back to Glasgow, suddenly the noise of the city is just too loud for me... Overall, I have really enjoyed the West Highland Way, the landscape and nature are very diverse and extremely beautiful.

**Since changes occur, some of the information I wrote might not be accurate today, so please check before planning your trip.**

If you plan to wild camp that is possible almost everywhere, under the Scottish Outdoor Access Code, except for the area of Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park. For that you have dedicated campsites such as the one of Sallochy. A map of the restricted area can be found [here](http://www.lochlomond-trossachs.org/things-to-do/camping/explore-permit-areas-map/).

Apparently, the months between June and August are quite popular for the West Highland Way. If I would do it again I would probably choose other time of the year, probably May. Also, I would reconsider the length of the first day and walk straight from Milngavie to Drymen and maybe from Tyndrum to Kingshouse on the sixth day.

### TLDR

+ Travel __light__, the path can be difficult with extra weight on your shoulders.
+ Take __hiking boots__ and a __jacket__. Make sure they are __waterproof__.
+ Always take 2L of water with you.
+ Beware the __midges__ in summer.
+ Use the .kml .gpx files above freely.
+ The path is very well marked.
+ Scottish have a very thick accent.
