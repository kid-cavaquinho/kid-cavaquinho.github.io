The [West Highland Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Highland_Way) is a long-distance trail in Scotland popular
among walkers, hikers, runners or even mountain bike cyclists. This trail is about 150km long and follows ancient
military roads, officially opened in 1980.
I have planned to walk it some months beforehand. Looking at the weather forecasts seems Scotland is quite
unpredictable.

With this in mind, I've decided to schedule a route and book in advance some bed and breakfasts or guest
houses along the trail. I've come up with the following plan:

+ Day 1 -> __Milngavie to Carbeth__ (
  8km) [.gpx](/content/whw/gpx/day-1-milngavie-to-carbeth.gpx) [.kml](/content/whw/kml/day-1-milngavie-to-carbeth.kml)
+ Day 2 -> __Carbeth to Drymen__ (
  11.2km) [.gpx](/content/whw/gpx/day-2-carbeth-to-drymen.gpx) [.kml](/content/whw/kml/day-2-carbeth-to-drymen.kml)
+ Day 3 -> __Drymen to Rowardennan__ (
  23km) [.gpx](/content/whw/gpx/day-3-drymen-to-rowardennan.gpx) [.kml](/content/whw/kml/day-3-drymen-to-rowardennan.kml)
+ Day 4 -> __Rowardennan to Inverarnan__ (
  22.4km) [.gpx](/content/whw/gpx/day-4-rowardennan-to-inverarnan.gpx) [.kml](/content/whw/kml/day-4-rowardennan-to-ardlui-and-inverarnan.kml)
+ Day 5 -> __Inverarnan to Tyndrum__ (
  19.6km) [.gpx](/content/whw/gpx/day-5-inverarnan-to-tyndrum.gpx) [.kml](/content/whw/kml/day-5-ardlui-and-inverarnan-to-tyndrum.kml)
+ Day 6 -> __Tyndrum to Bridge of Orchy__ (
  11.2km) [.gpx](/content/whw/gpx/day-6-tyndrum-to-bridge-of-orchy.gpx) [.kml](/content/whw/kml/day-6-tyndrum-to-bridge-of-orchy.kml)
+ Day 7 -> __Bridge of Orchy to Kingshouse__ (
  19.2km) [.gpx](/content/whw/gpx/day-7-bridge-of-orchy-to-kingshouse.gpx) [.kml](/content/whw/kml/day-7-bridge-of-orchy-to-kingshouse.kml)
+ Day 8 -> __Kingshouse to Kinlochleven__ (
  14.4km) [.gpx](/content/whw/gpx/day-8-kingshouse-to-kinglochleven.gpx) [.kml](/content/whw/kml/day-8-kingshouse-to-kinglochleven.kml)
+ Day 9 -> __Kinlochleven to Fort William__ (24
  km) [.gpx](/content/whw/gpx/day-9-kinlochleven-to-fort-william.gpx) [.kml](/content/whw/kml/day-9-kinlochleven-to-fort-william.kml)

The path is well-marked, and you will often see the West Highland Way sign . Nevertheless, I would advise you to
buy a waterproof map of the trail and a compass.

I've just landed in Glasgow, Scotland. I can't hide that I am a bit nervous... after all, this will be my first
long-distance hiking trail. A bus takes me from the airport to the heart of Glasgow city centre, from there I get on a
train to Milngavie.
(__pronounced 'Mulguye'__).

## Day 1 - Milngavie to Carbeth

The trail starts in the centre of the town, and a granite obelisk marks the spot. I am travelling light, and since I do
not have camping gear, I quickly arrive in Carbeth. The elevation is low so far. I feel I could continue to Drymen, but
since I have booked accommodation in advance, that is not an option.

## Day 2 - Carbeth to Drymen

![Carbeth to Drymen](/images/posts/whw/carbeth-to-drymen.png "Carbeth to Drymen")

The elevation is still low, and the path is still easy to walk, as described in the picture above.

## Day 3 - Drymen to Rowardennan

![Drymen to Rowardennan](/images/posts/whw/drymen-to-rowardennan.png "Drymen to Rowardennan")

In the picture above you can see Loch Lomond and the [Conic Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conic_Hill). The Conic
Hill separates the lowlands from the highlands. From the highest point, the path descends steeply to the beautiful
village of Balmaha where I stop for lunch by the pier. Nearby there is a statue
of [Tom Weir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Weir).

![Tom Weir](/images/posts/whw/tom-weir.png "Tom Weir")

Balmaha is the last place I will find an automated banking machine until reaching Kinlochleven, so I take some extra
money with me. The path follows Loch Lomond, which is quite beautiful.

At this point, because it is summer might be a good time to get your repellent spray because of
the [midges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highland_midge).

The rain fell hard on me during the day, and my legs start to feel tired. Luckily when I arrived at Rowardennan the sun
shined again, and I could enjoy this view. There are some restaurants, a campsite and hotels in Rowardennan.

## Day 4 - Rowardennan to Inverarnan

The path goes along Loch Lomond and it is slightly harder than in the previous days, the elevation is about 500 meters.
It will take me about five hours to walk 22km until I reach Inverarnan. After this long walk, I stop in
the [Beinglas campsite](https://www.beinglascampsite.co.uk/) there I found a shop and restaurant/bar with friendly
staff. Nearby, there is a hotel with over three hundred years of history
called [Drover's Inn](https://www.droversinn.co.uk/).

## Day 5 - Inverarnan to Tyndrum

From Inverarnan, the path becomes more mountainous, and the landscape is quite different from the previous days. The
weather is now quite foggy, and these are the Highlands I had imagined: __mountains surrounded by an air of mystery__.
In
Tyndrum there is a small supermarket, a few restaurants and a campsite.

## Day 6 - Tyndrum to Bridge of Orchy

Today is a shorter distance day, just 11km with little elevation from Tyndrum to Bridge of Orchy. I have time today to
rest well before the last days. In this village, there is a restaurant in the local hotel.

![Tyndrum to Bridge of Orchy](/images/posts/whw/tyndrum.png "Tyndrum to Bridge of Orchy")

## Day 7 - Bridge of Orchy to Kingshouse

The [Scottish breakfast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_breakfast#Scotland) helps me to get going in the morning.
Today, the path follows an old military road until Kingshouse, from there you will be confronted with the impressive
wild beauty of the Glencoe mountain. Close to Kingshouse, there is a [campsite](http://www.glencoemountain.co.uk/), in
the campsite there is a restaurant. Nearby, there is an [hotel](http://www.kingshousehotel.co.uk/).

## Day 8 - Kingshouse to Kinlochleven

From Kingshouse, I continue along old military roads. At a certain point, I will reach the known
ascent [Devil's Staircase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aonach_Eagach#Devil.27s_Staircase). I do not find it very
difficult compared with previous days. The elevation is about 400 meters. The weather is misty, so I descend quite
carefully
until Kinlochleven. Kinlochleven is a small village with some restaurants and a supermarket.

## Day 9 - Kinlochleven to Fort William

![Kinlochleven to Fort William](/images/posts/whw/kinlochleven.png "Kinlochleven to Fort William")

This is one of the hardest days, you will pass through some isolated areas along a scenic route. It is quite impressive
to sight [Ben Nevis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Nevis) for the first time. The walking trail ends in the town of
Fort William.

In Fort William, I bump into familiar faces I've been crossing paths with in the last few days. Everyone seems to
express a
feeling of accomplishment. Honestly, I feel it too. On the next day, I take a train back to Glasgow, and suddenly the
noise of the city is just too loud for me... Overall, I have enjoyed the West Highland Way, the landscape and nature are
diverse and extremely beautiful.

**Since changes occur, some of the information I wrote might not be accurate today, so please check before planning your
trip.**

Under the Scottish Outdoor Access Code you can wild camp almost everywhere. Except for Loch Lomond and the Trossachs
National Park areas. For that you have dedicated campsites such as the one of Sallochy. A map of the restricted areas
can be found [here](http://www.lochlomond-trossachs.org/things-to-do/camping/explore-permit-areas-map/).

Apparently, the months between June and August are popular for the West Highland Way. If I would do it again, I choose a
different time of the year, probably May. Also, I would reconsider the length of the first day and walk straight from
Milngavie to Drymen and maybe from Tyndrum to Kingshouse on the sixth day.

### TLDR

+ Travel __light__, the path can be difficult with extra weight on your shoulders.
+ Take __hiking boots__ and a __jacket__. Assure they are __waterproof__.
+ Always take 2L of water with you.
+ Beware the __midges__ in summer.
+ Use the .kml .gpx files above freely.
+ The path is very well marked.
+ Scottish have a very thick accent.
